I had written out the broad architecture and goals for the project, as well as all the math for implementing the first component in 
/home/nicole/Documents/mycorrhizae/scratchzero/docs/initial.md

What would be your takes on how you could implement this initial mnist classiciation CNN in rust, could you go ahead and tryh to describe what data types we would need, both for inference and training. And then try to organize those into broader modules.

Once done write all your thoughts to 

/home/nicole/Documents/mycorrhizae/scratchzero/docs/prompts/initial_architecture.md
