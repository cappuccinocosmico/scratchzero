    Sample efficiency remains a crucial challenge in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world tasks. While recent algorithms have made significant strides in improving sample efficiency, none have achieved consistently superior performance across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce EfficientZero V2, a general framework designed for sample-efficient RL algorithms.  
    We have expanded the performance of EfficientZero to multiple domains, encompassing both continuous and discrete actions, as well as visual and low-dimensional inputs. With a series of improvements we propose, EfficientZero V2 outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a significant margin in diverse tasks under the limited data setting. EfficientZero V2 exhibits a notable advancement over the prevailing general algorithm, DreamerV3, achieving superior outcomes in \textbf{50} of \textbf{66} evaluated tasks across diverse benchmarks, such as Atari 100k, Proprio Control, and Vision Control.
    % Notably, it surpasses the original EfficientZero by 17\% in the Atari 100k benchmark, and it exceeds Dreamer V3 by 15\% and 30\% in the Proprio Control 100k and Vision Control 200k benchmarks, respectively.

    % In this paper, we present EfficientZero V2, a general framework for sample efficient RL algorithms. Our work is built upon EfficientZero, which is well-known for its super-human performance on Atari 26 games with 2 hours human replay time. We extend it to multiple domains, including continuous and discrete actions, and visual and low-dimensional inputs. When evaluated on tasks with limited data availability, EfficientZero V2 significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art (SoTA) by a substantial margin. Specifically, it exceeds EfficientZero by 40\% in Atari 100k benchmark, and surpasses Dreamer V3 by 40\% and 30\% in Proprio Control 100k and Vision Control 200k benchmarks.
