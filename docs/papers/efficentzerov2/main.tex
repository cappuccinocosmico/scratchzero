\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents EfficienctZero V2 (EZ-V2), a general framework for sample efficient RL. EZ-V2, which is built upon EfficientZero, extends to master continuous control. Furthermore, EZ-V2 achieves both superior performance and sample efficiency in tasks with visual and low-dimensional inputs. More specifically, EZ-V2 outperforms Dreamer V3 by a large margin across various types of domains, including Atari 100k, Proprio Control, and Vision Control benchmarks.  
% While EZ-V2 presents exciting possibilities, it also comes with certain limitations. 
Moreover, we evaluate the performance of EZ-V2 without conditions of limited data. EZ-V2 outperforms or is comparable to baselines with more interaction data, though the performance gap between EZ-V2 and other algorithms narrows as the amount of interaction data increases. 
Due to the high sample efficiency, we will broaden our evaluation of EZ-V2 across a wider variety of benchmarks, especially in real-world tasks like robotic manipulation. The superior sample efficiency of EZ-V2 holds great promise for enhancing online learning in real-world robotic scenarios. 





% Future work should focus on enabling the learned model to handle safety considerations and risks, especially in real-world online learning scenarios like autonomous driving, where stochastic dynamics and interactions with other vehicles pose significant challenges. We encourage collaboration within the research community to tackle these challenges and drive further advancements in the field.


% While we are excited by the potential of EZ-V2, our limitations inspire future work. Taking online learning in the real world into account, we should enable the learned model to capture the unsafety regions and risks. In autonomous driving, the stochastic dynamics make the model learning more challenging due to the interaction with other vehicles.
% To address these challenges, pioneering research initiatives are essential, and we extend an invitation to the scholarly community to participate in these collaborative efforts.
